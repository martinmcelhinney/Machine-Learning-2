# Machine-Learning-2
This is a project I completed using Jupyter Notebook for the Machine Learning Module for my Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.  I received a grade of 90% for this project. 

This objective of this project was to propose a machine learning algorithm for the Breast Cancr Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

The approach taken was as follows:

Prepare/Pre-process the dataset and conduct an Exploritory analysis.

Conducted Preliminary Visualisations of the data.

Proposed a Logistic Regression Model for the dataset to predict the probability of a diagnosis being malignant or benign based on the features variables.

Performed feature scaling on the dataset to improve the performance of the algorithm by ensuring that all the features contribute equally to the learning process.

Performed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) on the dataset until the desired number of attributes are arrived upon.

Split the remaining dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the Logistic Model on the training set. Fit the logistic regression model to the training data.

Once the model has been trained it can be used to make predictions on new data using the predict method.

I proposed a Classification Report and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
